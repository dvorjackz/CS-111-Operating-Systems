Lab1b builds off the functionalities implemented in lab1a by introducing an extra connection layer - the client. Taking the terminal and shell setup from lab1a, we connect to the terminal, which serves as a server, through a client with TCP sockets. Basically, the client forwards keystrokes to the server through a socket, which forwards them to the shell through a pipe. The shell processes the commands, pipes the results back to the server, and the server forwards the output back to the client through a socket.

Available options include --port, which is mandatory and has a required argument, --log, which is optional but has a mandatory argument, and --compress, which is optional and requires no argument. --port specifies the port through which the client and server will interact via socket, --log creates/overwrites a file that records sent and received bytes, and --compress compresses data before it is sent through a socket and decompresses it after it is received from a socket.

Makefile targets:
dist: builds the .tar.gz distributable file
make: builds the server and client executables
clean: removes all .o and executable files
