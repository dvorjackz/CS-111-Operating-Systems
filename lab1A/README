A duplex terminal which has non-canonical I/O and no echo. A --shell option may be specified to spin up a separate child shell which receives and executes commands passed in from the terminal and writes the output back to the terminal. Pass in a ^C or ^D to close the shell and return to the terminal. 

The Makefile's targets are default, clean, and dist, all of which perform as would be expected.
